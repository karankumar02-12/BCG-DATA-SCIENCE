## Message Content

Hi PowerCo,

I hope you're doing well.

As discussed, our team is beginning to investigate the drivers behind customer churn, with a particular focus on the hypothesis that price sensitivity is a key factor. In order to thoroughly validate or disprove this idea, Estelle (our senior data scientist) and I have outlined the critical data points we'll need, along with the techniques we plan to use to uncover meaningful insights.

## Data Request

To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we kindly request access to the following datasets:

### 1. Customer Profile & Behavior Data
- Customer ID (anonymized)
- Contract start/end dates
- Plan type (e.g. fixed, variable)
- Monthly usage data (kWh or equivalent)
- Monthly billing amounts (base rate, surcharges, etc.)
- Customer acquisition channel (e.g. online, referral, phone)
- Tenure (length of time as a customer)
- Payment history (on-time vs. delinquent)
- Churn status and churn date (if applicable)

### 2. Pricing & Competitive Data
- Historical pricing structure for each plan
- Discounts/promotions offered during the contract
- Competitor price benchmarks (if available)

### 3. Customer Feedback & Support
- Support call logs (volume, topic, resolution status)
- Survey responses or NPS scores (if available)
- Complaint or service issue records

### 4. Demographic & Regional Info
- Customer location (zip code or region)
- Customer type (residential vs. commercial)
- Income bracket (if available)
- Availability of alternate energy providers in the region

## Analytical Approach

Once we have the necessary data, we'll follow a structured 5-step process:

### Five-Step Analysis Framework

1. **Business understanding & problem framing**  
   What is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it?

2. **Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning**  
   What data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?

3. **Feature engineering**  
   Can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?

4. **Modeling and evaluation**  
   Can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?

5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   How can we communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?

### Analytical Techniques

**Analysis Methods:**
- Correlation analysis between pricing and churn
- Cohort and survival analysis
- Logistic regression or classification models to identify churn predictors
- Segmentation to detect high-risk groups (e.g. price-sensitive customers)

**Deliverables:**
- Translate insights into clear, actionable recommendations (e.g. pricing strategy adjustments, customer retention tactics)

## Expected Outcomes

> **Key Objective:** We believe that with the right data, we'll be able to either confirm or challenge the hypothesis that price is the main churn driver—and also identify any other significant contributing factors such as service quality, plan type, or communication gaps.

## Next Steps

Please let us know if you need clarification on any of the requested data fields or if some data is not readily available. We're happy to adapt our approach based on what's feasible on your side.

Looking forward to your response.
